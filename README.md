## About
Since you are here learning about me, I will also divulge the fact that I like taking pretty pictures along with coding. Now you know **everything** about me.

## Disclaimer
Sorry I make a lot of private repos, so it looks like I dont have much activity.  
I promise I am still building some stuff :)

## Skills

```javascript
const stack = {
  react: ['jsx', 'React', 'HTML', 'css', 'redux', 'babel', 'webpack'],
  nodejs: ['javascript', 'typescript', 'npm', 'es5/6'],
  expressjs: ['rest', 'web_server', 'CDN'],
  nosql: ['mongodb', 'crud', 'authorization', 'authentication']
}

const cloud = {
  aws: ['serverless', 's3', 'ecr', 'ec2', 'cloudwatch', 'etc'],
  firebase: ['firestore', 'rtdb', 'functions']
}

const app = {
  web: ['MERN', 'html', 'css'],
  mobile: ['android', 'react-native']
}

const systems = {
  architecture: ['design_patterns', 'SOLID', 'docker', 'microservice'],
  messaging: ['kafka', 'rabbitmq'],
  testing: ['jest', 'postman', 'kibana', 'elastic'],
  cicd: ['git', 'gitlab', 'bitbucket', 'jenkins']
}

return {...stack, ...cloud, ...app, ...systems};
```

I just really wanted to put a code block in here somewhere. I know this could have just been a table.
